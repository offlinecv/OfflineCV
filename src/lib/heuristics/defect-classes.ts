 * Defect-class taxonomy + the load-bearing-axis table (issue #469).
 *
 * The six read-only parser probes each localize ONE section's defect to ONE
 * parser layer, and each ends by printing a `verdict` string. Those verdict
 * strings ARE the class taxonomy — they were just never named. This file names
 * them, and pairs each with (a) the `ReproArtifact` / `DerivedSignals` axes the
 * class actually lives on, and (b) a predicate that decides whether some OTHER
 * parse — a corpus fixture's — exhibits the same defect.
 *
 * ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 * │ WHY `DerivedSignals` IS BOOLEAN-ONLY — read before editing.               │
 * │                                                                           │
 * │ This file exists to answer "does any fixture already reproduce the defect │
 * │ this REAL résumé exposes?" — so it sits, by construction, one function    │
 * │ call away from a real name, a real email, a real phone, real bullet text. │
 * │ offlinecv is a PUBLIC repo. Anything this layer can carry is one         │
 * │ copy-paste from a public issue, and the `*.expected.json` corpus          │
 * │ snapshots (which will bake a `DerivedSignals` per fixture, #469 step 5)   │
 * │ are COMMITTED. A single free-form `string` slot here would turn both into │
 * │ a PII surface that looks innocuous.                                       │
 * │                                                                           │
 * │ `repro-artifact.ts` already solved this for the STRUCTURAL half: its      │
 * │ exported type admits only numbers, booleans, and fixed enums — PII-free   │
 * │ BY CONSTRUCTION, not by filtering — and `repro-artifact.test.ts` pins it. │
 * │ But `ReproArtifact` is structure-only, so it is BLIND to every defect      │
 * │ where a field is *present but wrong*: a phone whose digits got mangled, a │
 * │ name that absorbed a title, and all of the round-trip probe's domain.     │
 * │ `hasPhone: true` before and after says nothing about whether the digits    │
 * │ survived.                                                                  │
 * │                                                                           │
 * │ The fix is NOT to widen `ReproArtifact` with a string field — that breaks │
 * │ its PII assertion and defeats its file header. Instead, value-level        │
 * │ classes are expressed as DERIVED BOOLEANS: the predicate reads the real    │
 * │ values in memory, and only the VERDICT — one bit — is ever returned,       │
 * │ printed, or written. A boolean cannot leak an email.                       │
 * │                                                                           │
 * │ So: `DerivedSignals` is a flat, mapped, boolean-only type keyed off        │
 * │ `DERIVED_SIGNAL_KEYS`. There is deliberately NO `string` slot, no          │
 * │ `sample`, no `before`/`after`, no "just the failing bullet, for context".  │
 * │ `defect-classes.test.ts` pins that. If you need the literal text to build  │
 * │ a fixture, you re-export a template with a SYNTHETIC persona (CLAUDE.md);  │
 * │ you do not harvest it from the résumé under probe.                         │
 * └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  // │ Every OTHER key above is computed from some optional/nullable input of    │
  // │ the parse: `cascade.rawText`, `cascade.markdown`, `cascade.canonical.     │
  // │ sections`, or the round-trip hop's `after` parse. When that INPUT is      │
  // │ ABSENT, the key computes to `false` — and `false` there does NOT mean     │
  // │ "observed absent". It means UNKNOWABLE. A predicate reading it then       │
  // │ silently does not fire, and the sweep affirmatively reports NO DEFECT     │
  // │ over a parse whose oracles never ran. A false "clean" is strictly worse   │
  // │ than no answer: it tells the maintainer to stop looking.                  │
  // │                                                                           │

  // │ carries its own `*Unavailable` bit, every `DefectSpec` DECLARES which     │
  // │ oracles it `requires`, and `exhibits()` is GATED on them (see `spec()`    │
  // │ below). A class whose oracle is blind is WITHHELD, never guessed, and the │
  // │ harness prints the withheld list rather than an affirmative "no defects". │
  // │ Adding a `DerivedSignals` key means answering: what input does it read,   │
  // │ can that input be absent, and which oracle covers it?                     │

  // `scanned`, so the cascade short-circuits before Tier 1; or `rawText` is
  // empty). EVERY key above except the round-trip ones is derived from the
  // extracted text or from the sections cut out of it, so on such a parse they
  // are all false because there was nothing to read. This is offlinecv's single
