 * projections — pure `(CanonicalResume) => T` views that replace the direct
 * reads other subsystems used to make against `CascadeResult.parsed` /
 * `CascadeResult.sections` (#443, Stage B; `docs/canonical-resume-model.md` §2.1).
 *
 * Stage B introduces two projections:
 *   - {@link projectScoreSections} — the score projection: the section pools the
 *     anonymous scorer grades from (`AnonymousAtsScoreInput.sections`), replacing
 *     `SectionedResume.byName` read straight off the cascade result.
 *   - {@link projectDisplay} — the display projection: the parsed field core plus
 *     the user's own section headings, replacing `ReconstructedResume`'s direct
 *     `result.parsed` / `result.sections.sectionHeadings` reads.
 *
 * In Stage B these are **identity-holder** projections — they return the stored
 * cores by reference, so behaviour is byte-identical to the pre-projection
 * reads. The Stage-B byte-identical proof is the unchanged corpus goldens in
 * `heuristics/corpus.test.ts`; `projections.test.ts` here is the content /
 * re-derivation tripwire that fires when a later stage swaps a body. Their value
 * is the SEAM: Stage C+ can swap a body to re-derivation (section pools
 * recomputed from the canonical model, headings derived, etc.) without editing a
 * single call site.
 *
 * Routed through {@link projectDisplay} as of Stage C (#444):
 *   - `pdf/ats-resume-model.ts` — `buildAtsResumeModel` reads the field core and
 *     `sectionHeadings` for the exported PDF through {@link projectDisplay} (the
 *     render+export projection), not straight off `result.parsed` /
 *     `result.sections`.
 *
 * NOT yet routed through these projections (byte-identical today, but will drift
 * from the editor/scorer once Stage D+ makes a body re-derive — route them when
 * that stage lands):
 *   - `hooks/useResumeAnalysisLlm.ts` reads `result.sections.byName` for
 *     disagreement gating → fold into the llm-diff projection (Stage D).
